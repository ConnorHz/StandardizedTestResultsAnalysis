    "### 1. Charter schools outperform District schools\n",
    "When looking at the comparison of charter versus district schools as well as the top schools overall (in terms of percentage of students passing math and reading), it is clear that charter schools outperform district schools. Per the data, charter schools test higher in both reading and math and have they a higher percentage of students that pass both their reading and math tests. I think a common assumption would be that if a school had a higher budget per student, test scores would be higher as they'd have the financial resources to ensure the education of the students, but that doesn't seem to be the case. Most district schools have a higher budget per student than charter schools but are testing lower. I believe what really makes a difference is the size of the school. The data shows that the lower the student population, the higher the their test results are. What's not included in this dataset are the class sizes, which I could see playing a big role in detemining if school size is actually a factor. If charter and district schools had different student populations but the same class sizes, we'd have to look somewhere else to determine why charter schools are outperforming district ones.\n",
